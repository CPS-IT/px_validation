What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **PxValidation** extension (*px_validation*) enables the possibility to define different validation configuration in
your TypoScript for each **Extbase-Controller-Action** without touching the affected extension itself. This makes it easy
to change the default validation behaviour of vendor extensions without changing their code. But the greatest benefit
is that it opens the option to declare multiple variants of validation rules within one page tree. It is even possible
to nest validation rules, so you can validate child objects.
